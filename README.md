# calculator
The goal of this project is to make a calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


In contrast to Etch-a-sketch I found this one extremely difficult and I struggled so hard.

The main problem from the start was the lack of clarity. I didn't understand the problem and how to approach it and it all snowballed from there. Most of the times I was stumbling in the dark, trying different things hoping that something will magically start to work, I didn't know what part of code was executed at what time and I found it very hard to debug because of that.

Only when I asked for help I realized some of the mistakes in my thinking and in the end I managed to get it to work. I spent around 60 hours over 19 days on this project, most of that time was me thinking, trying to pseudocode, trying to get the logic to work and fixing various bugs and about 10% was styling.


Some of the things I learned:


- Ask for help early, especially if don't fully understand the problem you're dealing with. First step in solving a problem is to understand the problem.

- How to use the Chrome debugger and better use of console.logs. Before this project I didn't use the debugger at all because I didn't really know how to use it, but here I had to because I needed to check the state of my variables at different times to understand what whas going on with my code.
I also learned how to write better console.logs by putting them in every code block with the message "entering the first block, second block etc" so I know what code is being executed.

- I understand some Flexbox flex-wrap nuances much better.

- Rest is important.


Mistakes I've made/things to improve:


- I didn't use Git from the start. Because I wasn't sure how to go about this project and if any of the code I was writing was any good I didn't commit once until I was almost done.

- I didn't ask for help. I was too stubborn and I waited to hit the wall before I asked for any help.

- I didn't make a plan before I started to write my code. I should plan and pseudocode before I write anything.
